            <h3>Offence/Forwards:</h3>
            <p>The job of the offence is to play on the opposing teams side. They are the ones whose job it is to actually score goals on the oppsing net. <br> Though there is no rule that prevents them from backing up into their own side to help defend or get back the goal.</p>
