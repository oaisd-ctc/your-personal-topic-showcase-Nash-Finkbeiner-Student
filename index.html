            <h3>Offence/Forwards:</h3>
            <p>The job of the offence is to play on the opposing teams side. They are the ones whose job it is to actually score goals on the oppsing net. 
            <br> Though there is no rule that prevents them from backing up into their own side to help defend or get back the goal.<hr></p>

        <section class="Mid">
            <h3>Midfielders/Mid:</h3>
            <p>The midfield is the area around the line that splits the field, the job of the midfielders is to act as both extra defence or extra offnce depending on the situation. 
            <br>This is the most active and flexable role due to the fact that the area they need to pay attention to is so much bigger than either the defence or the offence.<hr> </p>
