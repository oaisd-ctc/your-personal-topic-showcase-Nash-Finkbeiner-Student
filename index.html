        <section class="Offence">
            <h3>Offence/Forwards:</h3>
            <p>The job of the offence is to play on the opposing teams side. They are the ones whose job it is to actually score goals on the oppsing net. 
            <br> Though there is no rule that prevents them from backing up into their own side to help defend or get back the goal.</p>

        <section class="Mid">
            <h3>Midfielders/Mid:</h3>
            <p>The midfield is the area around the line that splits the field, the job of the midfielders is to act as both extra defence or extra offnce depending on the situation. 
            <br>This is the most active and flexable role due to the fact that the area they need to pay attention to is so much bigger than either the defence or the offence.</p>
            <hr>
        </section>
        <section class="Defence"> 
            <h3>Defenders/Defence:</h3>
            <p>The Defenders/DefencAes job is to guard the backline and make sure that anytime the ball is sent back there, they are to send it back up to the enemy's side of the field.<br> They are also the second to last line of defence in case any other player attems to take the ball towards the defenders goal.</p>
            <hr>
        </section>
        <section class="GoalKeeper">
            <h3>Goalkeeper/Goalie</h3>
            <p>The Goalkeeper/Goalie is the ture last line of defence in case of an opponent getting to a teams goal. The goalie is the most unique of the positions, because compared to all the other ones it is the only one who can use its hands to grab the ball. though this is only allowed while in the box connected to the goal. <br>If the ball is picked up the goalie then can throw the ball, again only from inside the goalie box can this be done, to his teammates or as far as the person can phyiscally throw the ball.</p>
